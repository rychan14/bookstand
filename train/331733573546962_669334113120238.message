Looking for a kingston usb drive

I lost my kingston usb drive in the geisel library last night. It is a white one. I inserted it into one computer's usb port, but forgot to remove it when I left at about 10:30 pm. There is some very important data inside for me. I wonder whether anybody has any clue of it. My email is c2zhao@ucsd.edu. And my number is 8582608380. Thanks a lot.
